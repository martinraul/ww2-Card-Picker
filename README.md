**About the cards:**
` 
Used to identify Allied and Axis aircrafts, these World War II Airplane Spotter Cards provided servicemen with essential knowledge and also a fun pastime. This deck is a reproduction of the instructive decks first used in 1943.
Each card features 3 silhouettes of an Allied or Axis Power airplane as it would be seen by a ground observer or from another airplane.
Published by US Games Systems and printed in Italy.
